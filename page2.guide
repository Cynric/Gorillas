Gorillas - Hitting and Missing

    With some luck, you'll send your banana flying on a collision course with your opponent.

    On impact, your opponent will be obliterated.  Misses will leave nasty scars on the city scape.

    Gorillas take turns in throwing:  Miss, and watch as one comes flying right back at you.
