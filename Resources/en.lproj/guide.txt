-The Goal

    Sling your deadly bananas over the roof tops toward your opponent to blow him out of town.

    In Gorillas, you'll be trying to hit the opponent with deadly projectiles.  To aim, touch the screen and indicate the direction of your throw.  The length of your aim indicates its velocity.

-Hitting and Missing

    With some luck, you'll send your banana flying on a collision course with your opponent.

    On impact, your opponent will be obliterated.  Misses will leave nasty scars on the city scape.

    Gorillas take turns in throwing:  Miss, and watch as one comes flying right back at you.

-Controls

    You throw by tapping onto or dragging toward the location you want to aim at with one finger.

    Zooming is achieved by pinching or pulling the screen with two fingers.
    
    Notice that while aiming, you can add a second finger to the screen to cancel your aim.

+Configuration

    You can change the AI's difficulty level if you're interested in a real challenge.

    The gravity can also be controlled:  Less gravity means your bananas don't fall as fast.

    City themes completely change the game setting.  Different worlds have different gravities.

-Tactical 1

    The key to avoiding buildings is to throw more vertical and with more velocity.  This makes aiming quite a bit harder, though!

    Don't let buildings that are in your way stop you:  A few bananas should be sufficient to dig yourself a path through them.


===== NEXT PAGE =====
-Tactical 2

    Zoom out to get a wider aiming range.  That's especially handy for those long throws.
    
    Remember that high throws are better throws.  They land more vertically and are excellent for dodging buildings.
    Plus, in Dynamic games, if they hit, they'll yield far higher skill values.

-Statistics

    As your score evolves, your daily and global top scores are remembered.
    
    The Statistics panel in the Information menu graphs out your recent score history and shows your global top score.


===== NEXT PAGE =====
-Technical

    Your aim represents the vector of your throw's initial velocity.
    The current wind velocity will affect your banana's direction every step of the way.
    Higher difficulty means the AI will throw more accurately and prefers vertical shots over more horizontal ones.
