Configuration

    You can change the computer's current difficulity level if you're interested in a real challenge.
    The gravity can also be controlled:  Less gravity means your bananas don't fall as fast.
    City themes allow you to completely change the game setting.  Different worlds have different gravities and wind strengths.
