The Goal

    Sling your deadly bananas over the roof tops toward your opponent to blow him out of town.

    In Gorillas, you'll be trying to hit the opponent with deadly projectiles.  To aim, touch the screen and indicate the direction of your throw.  The length of your aim indicates its velocity.

Hitting and Missing

    With some luck, you'll send your banana flying on a collision course with your opponent.

    On impact, your opponent will be obliterated.  Misses will leave nasty scars on the city scape.

    Gorillas take turns in throwing:  Miss, and watch as one comes flying right back at you.

Single Player

    Playing against the computer is challanging and exciting.  Winning will make you go up in level, but as you do, the computer will get smarter.

    Winning a single player game gives you a nice score boost, but misses and dying will take away from that, so watch out!

Multi Player

    In company of others?  Gorillas is sure to excite as you take turns in blasting each other off the map.

    A multiplayer game will not affect your single player score and level progress.

Training

    Throw History allows you to see the aim of previous throws.

    Throw Hints show up briefly after every ten seconds and tell you where to aim.

    Note that you don't make any score or level progress while training mode is enabled.

Configuration

    You can change the computer's current difficulity level if you're interested in a real challenge.
    The gravity can also be controlled:  Less gravity means your bananas don't fall as fast.
    City themes allow you to completely change the game setting.  Different worlds have different gravities and wind strengths.

Tactical

    The key to avoiding buildings is to throw more vertical and with more velocity.  This makes aiming quite a bit harder, though!

    Don't let buildings that are in your way stop you:  A few bananas should be sufficient to dig yourself a path through them.

Statistics

    As your score evolves, your daily and global top scores are remembered.
    
    The Statistics panel in the Information menu graphs out your recent score history and shows your global top score.


===== NEXT PAGE =====
Technical

    Your aim represents the vector of your throw's initial velocity.
    The current wind velocity will affect your banana's direction every step of the way.
    The computer will throw more accurately as your difficulity level increases.  He will also begin preferring vertical shots over more horizontal ones.
